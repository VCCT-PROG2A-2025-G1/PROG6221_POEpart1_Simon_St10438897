## Overview

A WPF desktop application designed to educate users on cybersecurity best practices through four integrated modules:

* **Chat**: Interactive conversation with keyword-based Q\&A, sentiment detection, and in-chat commands.
* **Tasks**: GUI task manager for viewing, deleting, and completing cybersecurity tasks with optional reminders (added via the Chat tab using the `add task` command; no in-tab task creation).
* **Quiz**: 10-question multiple-choice cybersecurity quiz featuring immediate feedback, score tracking, and a Next button to advance.
* **Activity Log**: Timestamped record of the last 10 key actions (task added, reminder set, quiz start/completion).
